2. what is the difference between while and do while loop?
Ans:    
                WHILE LOOP            
        1. Syntax:                     
            while(condition){              
                //body                  
            }
        2. Condition is checked first then statement is executed
        3. It can happen that statement is executed zero times.
        4. If there is a single state then bracket is not required.
        5. An example of entry-controlled loop.


                DO-WHILE LOOP
        1. Syntax:
            do{
                //body
            }while(condition)
        2. Condition is checked at the last after the execution of statement.
        3. At least once the statement is executed.
        4. Brackets are always required.
        5. An example of exit-controlled loop.
